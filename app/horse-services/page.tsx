              <p className="mb-4">
                Iridology was discovered by Hippocrates over 2500 years ago, and was modernized by Bernard Jensen in
                1979. Iridology is the ancient science of analyzing the fiber structure, colour and marking of the iris
                of the eye. The iris records information about the emotional and physical state and function of every
                organ and gland in the body, as well as levels of inflammation and toxicity.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                A major advantage of this natural therapy is that changes record in the iris years before the physical
                symptoms actually develop. Therefore, it can be used as an early indicator, as well as a marker for past
                and present health issues.
              </p>
              <p>
                Iridology is a safe, simple and non-invasive method of assessment that can be integrated with any form
                of medicine. When Iridology is applied to animals, it can be used to: assess the fitness of pets before
                adoption or breeding, assess rescued animals with no known background, and determine if there is an
                underlying physical issue causing a behavioural problem.

              <p className="mb-4">
                Traditional Chinese Medicine was discovered in 1000 BC. Traditional Chinese Medicine functions on the
                principle that the body is an integrated, energetic structure and an imbalance anywhere affects the
                entire system. The main belief behind of this type of medicine is that our bodies can heal themselves we
                just have to nudge them back towards balance.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Acupressure is a form of TCM that aims to clear blockages in the energetic channels throughout the body
                by applying light pressure to acupoints to restore the harmonious flow of Chi. The bodys Chi can be
                disrupted, weakened, or blocked if there is imbalance between the pairs of yin and yang organs or
                between the Five Elements.There are many categories of acupressure points, some that are more powerful,
                some govern regions or systems of the body, and others that (re)connect organ systems.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Imbalances can display as: behavioural problems such as separation anxiety, difficulty concentrating, or
                aggression; physical problems such as joint pain, digestive issues, itchy skin, or other chronic
                wellness issues.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Seasonal Tune Up Sessions:</strong> As the seasons transition, one of the Five Elements is
                weakened and one is strengthened. Due to the intimate relationship between the Five Elements, this can
                create numerous imbalances in any of the Elements. For example, when moving from Spring to Summer, Fire
                gets stronger and Wood is weakened.

                Dr. Edward Bach, a renowned physician concluded almost 80 years ago that his patients illnesses were
                directly related to their negative states of mind. Flower Essences are dilute infusions of flowers and
                tree buds that can improve the mental state which subsequently influences the physical state. They
                simply replace the negative trait with its positive virtue. Flower Essences are totally safe,
                non-addictive, holistic, and completely compatible with conventional and homeopathic medicine.

                Flower Essences help animals with issues such as aggression, fear, depression, lack of confidence,
                separation anxiety, hyperactivity, and concentration issues. Essences can be especially helpful for
                emotional issues during or after a traumatic experience such as: thunderstorms, car rides, aggressive
                encounter with another animal, loss of another pet in the family, injuries, surgery, etc.

              <p className="mb-4">
                Cold Laser Therapy, or Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) is a form of light therapy. This involves the
                application of low power light (red and near infrared light) to injuries or closed wounds to improve
                healing and relieve acute and chronic pain.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                When low level laser light waves penetrate deeply into the skin, they optimize the immune responses of
                our blood. This helps to both strengthen the immune system and improve inflammation by supplying vital
                oxygen and energy to every cell. The aim is to bio-stimulate and because of the low power nature of
                these lasers, the effects are biochemical and not thermal and therefore, cannot cause heat damage to
                tissue. Especially beneficial for arthritis, joint pain, post-injury, or post-surgery healing.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                My lasers are not LEDs. Light Emitting Diodes are a very popular form of laser, but are a non-coherent
                source of light (scattered beam) as compared to the cold laser which is a coherent light source (focused
                beam). Clinical studies have shown that a focused beam penetrates much deeper into the tissues which
                allows for a more complete healing process.

                Reiki is a Japanese healing technique based on the principle that the therapist can channel energy into
                the patient by means of touch, to activate the natural healing processes of the patients body and
                restore physical and emotional well-being. They do this by moving the 'Rei' or 'life force energy' to
                parts of the body, meridians, or chakras that are unbalanced.

                can be given at any distance, under any circumstances to treat any problem. It is a powerful holistic
                therapy that always goes to the root of the problem, but causes no harm to recipient or practitioner." –

                communicate mentally. Many animal communicators also connect with animals that have passed away or are
                lost as this therapy is not limited by time or distance.

                An animal communication session helps you to gain a deeper understanding of your animal and help them
                feel heard. It is commonly used to determine why a behavioural problem occurred, how the animal feels
                physically or about changes, food choices, their routine, travelling, surgery, or death, etc.

                To do a session, all I need is a picture of your animal looking at the camera that doesn't have any
                other people or animals in it, your animal's name, age, and gender. Many pet parents also provide a list
                of specific questions or concerns going into the session and those are discussed with the animal.
