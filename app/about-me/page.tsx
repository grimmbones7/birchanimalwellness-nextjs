              I grew up in an environment where natural remedies and medicines were the norm. Complementary therapies such as chiropractic care, homeopathic medicine, and massage therapy got me through recovery from my car accident and the subsequent vertigo. I wouldn’t have the mobility I have without the weekly cold laser sessions I do on my knees and the tendon that tore in the accident. I know how much they’ve done for me, and I would love the opportunity to show you how they can change your life and your animal’s life.</p>
              <p>Many of my clients come to me because they have exhausted all other options or they don’t feel comfortable with the options their vet gave them; choose between an expensive surgery or a lifetime of medication. I understand the struggle of trying Western medicine and not getting any answers or the answer you were hoping for. My dog Kaia has had digestive issues since I got her. We’ve tried six different foods, and a variety of supplements to help her. Her fecal tests and bloodwork are normal whenever I got her tested. I was sent home with antibiotics that didn’t help her at all. I know how heart wrenching it is to watch your animal go through something and not be able to help.</p>
              <p>My sole desire is to help your animal have the highest quality of life possible and am willing to be part of your animal’s wellness team as long as you need me. </p>
